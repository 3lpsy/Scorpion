# Scorpion

This is an attempt to generate a CLI interface for a Covenant C2 server. It's also an opportunity for me to experiment with Dotnet Core. 

## TODO:
- Ability to add user
- Ability to remove user but not the last admin.
- Centralized Logging Class/Implementation
- Centralized Profile/Credential Class
- Ability to Authenticate Once and use old token.
